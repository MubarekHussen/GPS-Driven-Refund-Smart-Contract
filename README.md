# GPS-Driven Refund Smart Contract

## Overview

The GPS-Driven Refund Smart Contract project, developed by GeoLogix Solutions, aims to revolutionize the logistics and delivery industry through the integration of GPS and blockchain technology. This smart contract system automatically rewards drivers for maintaining compliance with designated geographic zones, ensuring timely deliveries and enhancing efficiency, reliability, and transparency in logistics operations.

## Features

- **Automated Rewards:** The smart contract automatically rewards drivers when they maintain compliance with designated geographic zones for set durations.
- **GPS Integration:** Utilizes GPS technology to track and verify driver locations in real-time.
- **Transparent and Efficient:** Enhances transparency and efficiency in logistics operations by automating the refund process based on GPS compliance.

## How It Works

1. **Deployment:** The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Driver Registration:** Drivers register their accounts and associated GPS devices with the smart contract.
3. **GPS Tracking:** The smart contract continuously monitors the GPS coordinates transmitted by the drivers' devices.
4. **Compliance Verification:** If a driver remains within the designated geographic zone for the specified duration, the smart contract automatically triggers a refund to the driver's account.
5. **Non-Compliance Handling:** If a driver deviates from the designated zone, the smart contract withholds the refund and updates the driver's compliance status accordingly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GPS-Driven Refund Smart Contract:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your Ethereum development environment (e.g., Brownie, Hardhat, or Truffle).
3. Deploy the smart contract on a testnet or local blockchain.
4. Test the smart contract functionality.
5. Integrate the smart contract with your logistics application or system.
